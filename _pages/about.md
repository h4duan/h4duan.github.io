Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Chris Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/) and [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/). My research focuses on developing AI algorithms to advance scientific discovery. I have built intelligent systems that generate accurate predictions and automate complex reasoning in various fields of natural sciences.

I am looking for collaborations and opportunities in both industry and academia. Please feel free to send me an email!
